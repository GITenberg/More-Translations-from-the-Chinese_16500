<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>This book is not intended to be representative of Chinese
literature as a whole. I have chosen and arranged chronologically
various pieces which interested me and which it
seemed possible to translate adequately.</p>

<p>An account of the history and technique of Chinese poetry
will be found in the introduction to my last book.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Learned reviewers must not suppose that I have failed to appreciate
the poets whom I do not translate. Nor can they
complain that the more famous of these poets are inaccessible
to European readers; about a hundred of Li Po&#8217;s
poems have been translated, and thirty or forty of Tu Fu&#8217;s.
I have, as before, given half my space to Po Ch&uuml;-i, of whose
poems I had selected for translation a much larger number
than I have succeeded in rendering. I will give literal versions
of two rejected ones:</p>


<h3>EVENING</h3>

<h4>[<i><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 835</i>]</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Water&#8217;s colour at-dusk still white;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sunsets glow in-the-dark gradually nil.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Windy lotus shakes [like] broken fan;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Wave-moon stirs [like] string [of] jewels.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Crickets chirping answer one another;</i><br /></span>

<h3><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>IN EARLY SPRING ALONE CLIMBING THE T&#8216;IEN-KUNG PAGODA</h3>

<h4>[<i><span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 389</i>]</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>T&#8216;ien-kung sun warm, pagoda door open;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Alone climbing, greet Spring, drink one cup.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Without limit excursion-people afar-off wonder at me;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What cause most old most first arrived!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While many of the pieces in &#8220;170 Chinese Poems&#8221; aimed
at literary form in English, others did no more than give
the sense of the Chinese in almost as crude a way as the
two examples above. It was probably because of this inconsistency
that no reviewer treated the book as an experiment
in English unrhymed verse, though this was the aspect
of it which most interested the writer.</p>

<p>In the present work I have aimed more consistently at
poetic form, but have included on account of their biographical
interest two or three rather unsuccessful versions
of late poems by Po Ch&uuml;-i.</p>

<p>For leave to reprint I am indebted to the editors of the
<i>English Review</i>, <i>Nation</i>, <i>New Statesman</i>, <i>Bulletin of School
of Oriental Studies</i>, and <i>Reconstruction</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_GREAT_SUMMONS" id="THE_GREAT_SUMMONS"></a>[1] THE GREAT SUMMONS</h3>


<p><i>When Ch&#8216;&uuml; Y&uuml;an had been exiled from the Court for
nine years, he became so despondent that he feared his
soul would part from his body and he would die. It was
then that he made the poem called &#8220;The Great Summons,&#8221;
calling upon his soul not to leave him.</i></p>

<p><i>To the Bachelor-of-Arts P&#8216;ei Ti</i></p>


<p>Of late during the sacrificial month, the weather has been
calm and clear, and I might easily have crossed the mountain.
But I knew that you were conning the classics and
did not dare disturb you. So I roamed about the mountain-side,
rested at the Kan-p&#8216;ei Temple, dined with the
mountain priests, and, after dinner, came home again. Going
northwards, I crossed the Y&uuml;an-pa, over whose waters
the unclouded moon shone with dazzling rim. When night
was far advanced, I mounted Hua-tz&uuml;&#8217;s Hill and saw the
moonlight tossed up and thrown down by the jostling waves
of Wang River. On the wintry mountain distant lights
twinkled and vanished; in some deep lane beyond the forest
a dog barked at the cold, with a cry as fierce as a wolf&#8217;s.
The sound of villagers grinding their corn at night filled
the gaps between the slow chiming of a distant bell.</p>

<p>Now I am sitting alone. I listen, but cannot hear my
grooms and servants move or speak. I think much of
old days: how hand in hand, composing poems as we
went, we walked down twisting paths to the banks of clear
streams.</p>

<p>We must wait for Spring to come: till the grasses sprout
and the trees bloom. Then wandering together in the spring
hills we shall see the trout leap lightly from the stream, the
white gulls stretch their wings, the dew fall on the green
moss. And in the morning we shall hear the cry of curlews
in the barley-fields.</p>

<p>It is not long to wait. Shall you be with me then? Did
I not know the natural subtlety of your intelligence, I would
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>not dare address to you so remote an invitation. You will
understand that a deep feeling dictates this course.</p>

<p>Written without disrespect by Wang Wei, a dweller in the
mountains.</p>

<h4>I</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A cup of wine, under the flowering trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drink alone, for no friend is near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raising my cup I beckon the bright moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he, with my shadow, will make three men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon, alas, is no drinker of wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listless, my shadow creeps about at my side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with the moon as friend and the shadow as slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must make merry before the Spring is spent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the songs I sing the moon flickers her beams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dance I weave my shadow tangles and breaks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we were sober, three shared the fun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now we are drunk, each goes his way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May we long share our odd, inanimate feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meet at last on the Cloudy River of the sky.<a name="FNanchor_1_4" id="FNanchor_1_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_4" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>

<h4>II</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the third month the town of Hsien-yang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is thick-spread with a carpet of fallen flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who in Spring can bear to grieve alone?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, sober, look on sights like these?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Riches and Poverty, long or short life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Maker of Things are portioned and disposed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a cup of wine levels life and death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a thousand things obstinately hard to prove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I am drunk, I lose Heaven and Earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>Motionless&mdash;I cleave to my lonely bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last I forget that I exist at all,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And birds linger on the last boughs that bloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards evening when the sky grew clearer yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the South-east was still clothed in red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the western cloister we carried our jar of wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While we waited for the moon, our cups moved slow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon, how soon her golden ghost was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly, as though she had waited for us to come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beams of her light shone in every place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On towers and halls dancing to and fro.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till day broke we sat in her clear light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughing and singing, and yet never grew tired.<br /></span>

<p>Night of the tenth day of the fourth month. Lo-t&#8216;ien<a name="FNanchor_1_15" id="FNanchor_1_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_15" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> says:
O Wei-chih,<a name="FNanchor_2_16" id="FNanchor_2_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_16" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Wei-chih, it is three years since I saw your
face and almost two years since I had a letter from you. Is
man&#8217;s life so long that he can afford such partings? Much
less should hearts joined by glue be set in bodies remote
as Hu and Y&uuml;eh.<a name="FNanchor_3_17" id="FNanchor_3_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_17" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In promotion we could not be together;
and in failure we cannot forget each other. Snatched and
wrenched apart, separately each of us grows grey. O
Wei-chih, what is to be done? But this is the work of
Heaven and there is no use in speaking of it.</p>

<p>When I first arrived at Hs&uuml;n-yang, Hsiung Ju-t&#275;ng<a name="FNanchor_4_18" id="FNanchor_4_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_18" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
came with the letter which you had written the year before,
when you were so ill. First you told me of the progress
of your illness, next of your feelings while you were ill
and last you spoke of all our meetings and partings, and
of the occasion of your own difficulties and dangers. You
had no time to write more, but sent a bundle of your
writings with a note attached, which said, &#8220;Later on I will
send a message by Po Min-chung.<a name="FNanchor_5_19" id="FNanchor_5_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_19" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Ask him for news
and that will do instead of a letter.&#8221; Alas! Is it thus
that Wei-chih treats me? But again, I read the poem you
wrote when you heard I had been banished:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><p><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></p>
<span class="i0"><i>The lamp had almost spent its light: shadows filled the room,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The night I heard that Lo-t&#8216;ien was banished to Kiu-kiang.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And I that had lain sick to death sat up suddenly in bed;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>A dark wind blowing rain entered at the cold window.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If even strangers&#8217; hearts are touched by these lines,
much more must mine be; so that to this day I cannot recite
them without pain. Of this matter I will say no more,
but tell you briefly what has passed of late.</p>

<p>It is more than three years since I came to Kiu-kiang.
All this time my body has been strong and my heart much
at peace. There has been no sickness in my household,
even among the servants. Last summer my elder brother
arrived from Hs&uuml;-chou, leading by the hand six or seven
little brothers and sisters, orphans of various households.
So that I have under my eyes all those who at present demand
my care. They share with me cold and heat, hunger
and satiety. This is my first consolation.</p>

<p>The climate of the River Province is somewhat cool, so
that fevers and epidemics are rare. And while snakes and
mosquitoes are few, the fish in the P&#275;n are remarkably fat,
the River wine is exceedingly good, and indeed for the most
part the food is like that of the North Country. Although
the mouths within my doors are many and the salary of a
Sub-Prefect is small, by a thrifty application of my means,
I am yet able to provide for my household without seeking
any man&#8217;s assistance to clothe their backs or fill their bellies.
This is my second consolation.</p>

<p>In the autumn of last year I visited Lu Shan<a name="FNanchor_6_20" id="FNanchor_6_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_20" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> for the
first time. Reaching a point between the Eastern Forest
and Western Forest Temples, beneath the Incense-Burner
Peak, I was enamoured by the unequalled prospect of
<a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>cloud-girt waters and spray-clad rocks. Unable to leave
this place, I built a cottage here. Before it stand ten tall
pines and a thousand tapering bamboos. With green
creepers I fenced my garden; with white stones I made
bridge and path. Flowing waters encircle my home; flying
spray falls between the eaves. Red pomegranate and
white lotus cluster on the steps of the pond. All is after
this pattern, though I cannot here name each delight.
Whenever I come here alone, I am moved to prolong my
stay to ten days; for of the things that have all my life
most pleased me, not one is missing. So that not only do
I forget to go back, but would gladly end my days here.
This is my third consolation.</p>

<p>Remembering that not having had news of me for so long,
you might be in some anxiety with regard to me, I have
hastened to set your mind at rest by recording these three
consolations. What else I have to tell shall be set out in
due order, as follows....<a name="FNanchor_7_21" id="FNanchor_7_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_21" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Wei-chih, Wei-chih! The night I wrote this letter I
was sitting at the mountain-window of my thatched hut.
I let my brush run as my hand willed and wrote at hazard
as my thoughts came. When I folded it and addressed it,
I found that dawn had come. I raised my head and saw
only a few mountain-priests, some sitting, some sleeping.
I heard the mournful cries of mountain apes and the sad
twitterings of valley birds. O friend of all my life, parted
from me by a thousand leagues, at such times as this &#8220;dim
thoughts of the World&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8_22" id="FNanchor_8_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_22" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> creep upon me for a while; so,
<a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>following my ancient custom, I send you these three
couplets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I remember how once I wrote you a letter sitting in the Palace at night,</i><br /></span>

<h4>[<i>Circa <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 840</i>]</h4>


<p>When Lo-t&#8216;ien[1] was old, he fell ill of a palsy. So he
made a list of his possessions and examined his expenses,
that he might reject whatever had become superfluous. He
had in his employ a girl about twenty years old called Fan
Su, whose postures delighted him when she sang or danced.
But above all she excelled in singing the &#8220;Willow-Branch,&#8221;
so that many called her by the name of this song, and she
was well known by this name in the town of Lo-yang. But
she was on the list of unnecessary expenses and was to be
sent away.</p>

<p>He had too a white horse with black mane, sturdy and
sure-footed, which he had ridden for many years. It stood
on the list of things which could be dispensed with, and was
to be sold. When the groom led the horse through the
gate, it tossed its head and looked back, neighing once
with a sound in its voice that seemed to say: &#8220;I know I am
leaving you and long to stay.&#8221; Su, when she heard the
horse neigh, rose timidly, bowed before me and spoke
sweetly, as shall hereafter be shown. When she had done
speaking her tears fell.</p>

<p>When first I heard Su&#8217;s words, I was too sad to speak
and could not answer her. But in a little while I ordered
the bridle to be turned and the sleeve reversed.<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Then I
gave her wine and drank a cup myself, and in my happiness
sang a few score notes. And these notes turned into a
poem, a poem without fixed measure, for the measure followed
my irregular tune. In all there were 255 words.</p>

<p><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>Alas! I am no Sage. I could neither forget past feelings
nor show such sensibility as this beast reputed incapable
of feeling! Things that happen lay hold of my
heart, and when my heart is moved, I cannot control it.
Therefore, smiling at myself, I called this song &#8220;A Song of
Past Feelings Unforgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the Ch&#275;ng-Y&uuml;an<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> period of the T&#8216;ang dynasty
there lived a man called Chang.<a name="FNanchor_2_38" id="FNanchor_2_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_38" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> His nature was gentle
and refined, and his person of great beauty. But his deeper
feelings were resolutely held in restraint, and he would indulge
in no license. Sometimes his friends took him to a
party and he would try to join their frolics; but when the
rest were shouting and scuffling their hardest, Chang only
pretended to take his share. For he could never overcome
his shyness. So it came about that though already twenty-three,
he had not yet enjoyed a woman&#8217;s beauty. To those
who questioned him he answered, &#8220;It is not such as Master
T&#275;ng-t&#8217;u<a name="FNanchor_3_39" id="FNanchor_3_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_39" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> who are true lovers of beauty; for they are merely
profligates. I consider myself a lover of beauty, who happens
never to have met with it. And I am of this opinion
because I know that, in other things, whatever is beautiful
casts its spell upon me; so that I cannot be devoid of feeling.&#8221;
His questioners only laughed.</p>

<p>About this time Chang went to Puchow. Some two miles
east of the town there is a temple called the P&#8216;-u-chiu-ss&#365;,
and here he took up his lodging. Now it happened that at
this time the widow of a certain Ts&#8216;ui was returning to
Ch&#8216;ang-an.<a name="FNanchor_4_40" id="FNanchor_4_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_40" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> She passed through Puchow on her way and
stayed at the same temple.</p>

<p>This lady was born of the Ch&#275;ng family and Chang&#8217;s
mother was also a Ch&#275;ng. He unravelled their relationship
and found that they were second-cousins.</p>

<p><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>This year General Hun-Chan<a name="FNanchor_5_41" id="FNanchor_5_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_41" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> died at Puchow. There
was a certain Colonel Ting W&#275;n-ya who ill-treated his
troops. The soldiers accordingly made Hun Chan&#8217;s funeral
the occasion of a mutiny, and began to plunder the
town. The Ts&#8216;ui family had brought with them much valuable
property and many slaves. Subjected to this sudden
danger when far from home, they had no one from whom
they could seek protection.</p>

<p>Now it happened that Chang had been friendly with the
political party to which the commander at Puchow belonged.
At his request a guard was sent to the temple and
no disorder took place there. A few days afterwards the
Civil Commissioner Tu Chio was ordered by the Emperor
to take over the command of the troops. The mutineers
then laid down their arms.</p>

<p>The widow Ch&#275;ng was very sensible of the service which
Chang had rendered. She therefore provided dainties and
invited him to a banquet in the middle hall. At table she
turned to him and said, &#8220;I, your cousin, a lonely and
widowed relict, had young ones in my care. If we had
fallen into the hands of the soldiery, I could not have
helped them. Therefore the lives of my little boy and
young daughter were saved by your protection, and they
owe you eternal gratitude. I will now cause them to kneel
before you, their merciful cousin, that they may thank you
for your favours.&#8221; First she sent for her son, Huan-lang,
who was about ten years old, a handsome and gentle
child. Then she called to her daughter, Ying-ying: &#8220;Come
and bow to your cousin. Your cousin saved your life.&#8221;
For a long while she would not come, saying that she was
<a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>not well. The widow grew angry and cried: &#8220;Your cousin
saved your life. But for his help, you would now be a
prisoner. How can you treat him so rudely?&#8221;</p>

<p>At last she came in, dressed in everyday clothes, with a
look of deep unhappiness in her face. She had not put on
any ornaments. Her hair hung down in coils, the black of
her two eyebrows joined, her cheeks were not rouged. But
her features were of exquisite beauty and shone with an almost
dazzling lustre.</p>

<p>Chang bowed to her, amazed. She sat down by her
mother&#8217;s side and looked all the time towards her, turning
from him with a fixed stare of aversion, as though she could
not endure his presence.</p>

<p>He asked how old she was. The widow answered, &#8220;She
was born in the year of the present Emperor&#8217;s reign that was
a year of the Rat, and now it is the year of the Dragon in the
period Ch&#275;ng-y&uuml;an.<a name="FNanchor_6_42" id="FNanchor_6_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_42" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> So she must be seventeen years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chang tried to engage her in conversation, but she would
not answer, and soon the dinner was over. He was passionately
in love with her and wanted to tell her so, but could
find no way.</p>

<p>Ying-ying had a maid-servant called Hung-niang, whom
Chang sometimes met and greeted. Once he stopped her
and was beginning to tell her of his love for her mistress;
but she was frightened and ran away. Then Chang was
sorry he had not kept silence.</p>

<p>Next day he met Hung-niang again, but was ashamed and
did not say what was in his mind. But this time the maid
herself broached the subject and said to Chang, &#8220;Master, I
dare not tell her what you told me, or even hint at it. But
<a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>since your mother was a kinswoman of the Ts&#8216;uis, why do
you not seek my mistress&#8217;s hand on that plea?&#8221;</p>

<p>Chang said, &#8220;Since I was a child in arms, my nature has
been averse to intimacy. Sometimes I have idled with
wearers of silk and gauze, but my fancy was never once
detained. I little thought that in the end I should be entrapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lately at the banquet I could scarcely contain myself;
and since then, when I walk, I forget where I am going
and when I eat, I forget to finish my meal, and do not know
how to endure the hours from dawn to dusk.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we were to get married through a matchmaker and
perform the ceremonies of Sending Presents and Asking
Names, it would take many months, and by that time you
would have to look for me &#8216;in the dried-fish shop.&#8217; What
is the use of giving me such advice as that?&#8221;</p>

<p>The maid replied, &#8220;My mistress clings steadfastly to
her chastity, and even an equal could not trip her with lewd
talk. Much less may she be won through the stratagems of
a maid-servant. But she is skilled in composition, and often
when she has made a poem or essay, she is restless and dissatisfied
for a long while after. You must try to provoke
her by a love-poem. There is no other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chang was delighted and at once composed two Spring
Poems to send her. Hung-niang took them away and came
back the same evening with a coloured tablet, which she
gave to Chang, saying, &#8220;This is from my mistress.&#8221; It
bore the title &#8220;The Bright Moon of the Fifteenth Night.&#8221;
The words ran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>To wait for the moon I am sitting in the western parlour;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>To greet the wind, I have left the door ajar.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><i>When a flower&#8217;s shadow stirred and brushed the wall,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For a moment I thought it the shadow of a lover coming.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Chang could not doubt her meaning. That night was
the fourth after the first decade of the second month. Beside
the eastern wall of Ts&#8216;ui&#8217;s apartments there grew an
apricot-tree; by climbing it one could cross the wall. On
the next night (which was the night of the full moon) Chang
used the tree as a ladder and crossed the wall. He went
straight to the western parlour and found the door ajar.
Hung-niang lay asleep on the bed. He woke her, and she
cried in a voice of astonishment, &#8220;Master Chang, what are
you doing here?&#8221; Chang answered, half-truly: &#8220;Ts&#8216;ui&#8217;s
letter invited me. Tell her I have come.&#8221; Hung-niang
soon returned, whispering, &#8220;She is coming, she is coming.&#8221;
Chang was both delighted and surprised, thinking that his
salvation was indeed at hand.</p>

<p>At last Ts&#8216;ui entered.</p>

<p>Her dress was sober and correct, and her face was stern.
She at once began to reprimand Chang, saying, &#8220;I am
grateful for the service which you rendered to my family.
You gave support to my dear mother when she was at a loss
how to save her little boy and young daughter. How came
you to send me a wicked message by the hand of a low maid-servant?
In protecting me from the license of others, you
acted nobly. But now that you wish to make me a partner
to your own licentious desires, you are asking me to accept
one wrong in exchange for another.</p>

<p>&#8220;How was I to repel this advance? I would gladly have
hidden your letter, but it would have been immoral to
harbour a record of illicit proposals. Had I shown it to
my mother, I should ill have requited the debt we owe you.
<a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>Were I to entrust a message of refusal to a servant or concubine,
I feared it might not be truly delivered. I thought
of writing a letter to tell you what I felt; but I was afraid
I might not be able to make you understand. So I sent
those trivial verses, that I might be sure of your coming. I
have no cause to be ashamed of an irregularity which had
no other object but the preservation of my chastity.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words she vanished. Chang remained for a
long while petrified with astonishment. At last he climbed
back over the wall and went home in despair.</p>

<p>Several nights after this he was lying asleep near the
verandah, when some one suddenly woke him. He rose
with a startled sigh and found that Hung-niang was there,
with <a name="typo_4" id="typo_4"></a>bedclothes under her arm and a pillow in her hand.
She shook Chang, saying, &#8220;She is coming, she is coming.
Why are you asleep?&#8221; Then she arranged the bedclothes
and pillow and went away.</p>

<p>Chang sat up and rubbed his eyes. For a long while he
thought he must be dreaming, but he assumed a respectful
attitude and waited.</p>

<p>Suddenly Hung-niang came back, bringing her mistress
with her. Ts&#8216;ui, this time, was languid and flushed, yielding
and wanton in her air, as though her strength could
scarcely support her limbs. Her former severity had
utterly disappeared.</p>

<p>That night was the eighth of the second decade. The crystal
beams of the sinking moon twinkled secretly across their
bed. Chang, in a strange exaltation, half-believed that a
fairy had come to him, and not a child of mortal men.</p>

<p>At last the temple bell sounded, dawn glimmered in the
sky and Hung-niang came back to fetch her mistress away.
Ts&#8216;ui turned on her side with a pretty cry, and followed her
maid to the door.</p>

<p><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>The whole night she had not spoken a word.</p>

<p>Chang rose when it was half-dark, still thinking that perhaps
it had been a dream. But when it grew light, he saw
her powder on his arm and smelt her perfume in his clothes.
A tear she had shed still glittered on the mattress.</p>

<p>For more than ten days afterwards he did not see her
again. During this time he began to make a poem called
&#8220;Meeting a Fairy,&#8221; in thirty couplets. It was not yet finished,
when he chanced to meet Hung-niang in the road.
He asked her to take the poem to Ts&#8216;ui.</p>

<p>After this Ts&#8216;ui let him come to her, and for a month or
more he crept out at dawn and in at dusk, the two of them
living together in that western parlour of which I spoke
before.</p>

<p>Chang often asked her what her mother thought of him.
Ts&#8216;ui said, &#8220;I know she would not oppose my will. So why
should we not get married at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, Chang had to go to the capital. Before
starting, he tenderly informed her of his departure.
She did not reproach him, but her face showed pitiable distress.
On the night before he started, he was not able to
see her.</p>

<p>After spending a few months in the west, Chang returned
to Puchow and again lodged for several months in the same
building as the Ts&#8216;uis. He made many attempts to see
Ying-ying alone, but she would not let him do so. Remembering
that she was fond of calligraphy and verse, he frequently
sent her his own compositions, but she scarcely
glanced at them.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of her that when any situation was
at its acutest point, she appeared quite unconscious of it.
She talked glibly, but would seldom answer a question.
<a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>She expected absolute devotion, but herself gave no encouragement.</p>

<p>Sometimes when she was in the depth of despair, she
would affect all the while to be quite indifferent. It was
rarely possible to know from her face whether she was
pleased or sorry.</p>

<p>One night Chang came upon her unawares when she was
playing on the harp, with a touch full of passion. But
when she saw him coming, she stopped playing. This incident
increased his infatuation.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, it became time for him to compete in
the Literary Examinations, and he was obliged once more
to set out for the western capital.</p>

<p>The evening before his departure, he sat in deep despondency
by Ts&#8216;ui&#8217;s side, but did not try again to tell her
of his love. Nor had he told her that he was going away,
but she seemed to have guessed it, and with submissive face
and gentle voice, she said to him softly: &#8220;Those whom a
man leads astray, he will in the end abandon. It must be
so, and I will not reproach you. You deigned to corrupt me
and now you deign to leave me. That is all. And your
vows of &#8216;faithfulness till death&#8217;&mdash;they too are cancelled.
There is no need for you to grieve at this parting, but since
I see you so sad and can give you no other comfort&mdash;you
once praised my harp-playing; but I was bashful and would
not play to you. Now I am bolder, and if you choose, I
will play you a tune.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took her harp and began the prelude to &#8220;Rainbow
Skirts and Feather Jackets.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_7_43" id="FNanchor_7_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_43" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> But after a few bars the
tune broke off into a wild and passionate dirge.</p>

<p><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>All who were present caught their breath; but in a moment
she stopped playing, threw down her harp and, weeping
bitterly, ran to her mother&#8217;s room.</p>

<p>She did not come back.</p>

<p>Next morning Chang left. The following year he failed
in his examinations and could not leave the capital. So, to
unburden his heart, he wrote a letter to Ts&#8216;ui. She answered
him somewhat in this fashion: &#8220;I have read your
letter and cherish it dearly. It has filled my heart half
with sorrow, half with joy. You sent with it a box of
garlands and five sticks of paste, that I may decorate my
head and colour my lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for your presents; but there is no one now
to care how I look. Seeing these things only makes me
think of you and grieve the more.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that you are prospering in your career at the
capital, and I am comforted by that news. But it makes
me fear you will never come back again to one who is so
distant and humble. But <i>that</i> is settled forever, and it is
no use talking of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since last autumn I have lived in a dazed stupor. Amid
the clamour of the daytime, I have sometimes forced myself
to laugh and talk; but alone at night I have done nothing
but weep. Or, if I have fallen asleep my dreams have always
been full of the sorrows of parting. Often I dreamt
that you came to me as you used to do, but always before
the moment of our joy your phantom vanished from my
side. Yet, though we are still bedfellows in my dreams,
when I wake and think of it the time when we were together
seems very far off. For since we parted, the old year has
slipped away and a new year has begun....</p>

<p><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>&#8220;Ch&#8216;ang-an is a city of pleasure, where there are many
snares to catch a young man&#8217;s heart. How can I hope that
you will not forget one so sequestered and insignificant as
I? And indeed, if you were to be faithful, so worthless a
creature could never requite you. But our vows of unending
love&mdash;those <i>I</i> at least can fulfil.</p>

<p><a name="typo_2" id="typo_2"></a>&#8220;Because you are my cousin, I met you at the feast. Lured
by a maid-servant, I visited you in private. A girl&#8217;s heart
is not in her own keeping. You &#8216;tempted me by your ballads&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_8_44" id="FNanchor_8_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_44" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and I could not bring myself to &#8216;throw the shuttle.&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_9_45" id="FNanchor_9_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_45" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Then came the sharing of pillow and mat, the time of
perfect loyalty and deepest tenderness. And I, being young
and foolish, thought it would never end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, having &#8216;seen my Prince,&#8217;<a name="FNanchor_10_46" id="FNanchor_10_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_46" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I cannot love again; nor,
branded by the shame of self-surrender, am I fit to perform
&#8216;the service of towel and comb&#8217;;<a name="FNanchor_11_47" id="FNanchor_11_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_47" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and of the bitterness of
the long celibacy which awaits me, what need is there to
speak?</p>

<p>&#8220;The good man uses his heart; and if by chance his gaze
has fallen on the humble and insignificant, till the day of
his death, he continues the affections of his life. The cynic
cares nothing for people&#8217;s feelings. He will discard the
small to follow the great, look upon a former mistress
merely as an accomplice in sin, and hold that the most
solemn vows are made only to be broken. He will reverse
all natural laws&mdash;as though Nature should suddenly let
bone dissolve, while cinnabar resisted the fire. The dew
<a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>that the wind has shaken from the tree still looks for kindness
from the dust; and such, too, is the sum of <i>my</i> hopes
and fears.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I write, I am shaken by sobs and cannot tell you all
that is in my heart. My darling, I am sending you a jade
ring that I used to play with when I was a child. I want
you to wear it at your girdle, that you may become firm
and flawless as this jade, and, in your affections, unbroken
as the circuit of this ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;And with it I am sending a skein of thread and a tea-trough
of flecked bamboo. There is no value in these few
things. I send them only to remind you to keep your heart
pure as jade and your affection unending as this round ring.
The bamboo is mottled as if with tears, and the thread is
tangled as the thoughts of those who are in sorrow. By
these tokens I seek no more than that, knowing the truth,
you may think kindly of me for ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our hearts are very near, but our bodies are far apart.
There is no time fixed for our meeting; yet a secret longing
can unite souls that are separated by a thousand miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Protect yourself against the cold spring wind, eat well&mdash;look
after yourself in all ways and do not worry too
much about your worthless handmaid,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Ts&#8216;ui Ying-ying</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chang showed this letter to his friends and so the story
became known to many who lived at that time. All who
heard it were deeply moved; but Chang, to their disappointment,
declared that he meant to break with Ts&#8216;ui.
Y&uuml;an Ch&#275;n, of Honan, who knew Chang well, asked him
why he had made this decision.</p>

<p><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>Chang answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have observed that in Nature whatever has perfect
beauty is either itself liable to sudden transformations or
else is the cause of them in others. If Ts&#8216;ui were to marry
a rich gentleman and become his pet, she would forever be
changing, as the clouds change to rain, or as the scaly
dragon turns into the horned dragon. I, for one, could
never keep pace with her transformations.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of old, Hsin of the Yin dynasty and Yu of the Chou
dynasty ruled over kingdoms of many thousand chariots,
and their strength was very great. Yet a single woman
brought them to ruin, dissipating their hosts and leading
these monarchs to the assassin&#8217;s knife. So that to this day
they are a laughing-stock to all the world. I know that
my constancy could not withstand such spells, and that is
why I have curbed my passion.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words all who were present sighed deeply.</p>

<p>A few years afterwards Ts&#8216;ui married some one else and
Chang also found a wife. Happening once to pass the
house where Ts&#8216;ui was living, he called on her husband and
asked to see her, saying he was her cousin. The husband
sent for her, but she would not come. Chang&#8217;s vexation
showed itself in his face. Some one told Ts&#8216;ui of this and
she secretly wrote the poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Since I have grown so lean, my face has lost its beauty.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>I have tossed and turned so many times that I am too tired to leave my bed.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It is not that I mind the others seeing</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>How ugly I have grown;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It is </i>you<i> who have caused me to lose my beauty,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yet it is </i>you<i> I am ashamed should see me!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>Chang went away without meeting her, and a few days
afterwards, when he was leaving the town, wrote a poem of
final farewell, which said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>You cannot say that you are abandoned and deserted;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For you have found some one to love you.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Why do you not convert your broodings over the past</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Into kindness to your present husband?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>After that they never heard of one another again. Many
of Chang&#8217;s contemporaries praised the skill with which he
extricated himself from this entanglement.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I dreamt I climbed to a high, high plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the plain I found a deep well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My throat was dry with climbing and I longed to drink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my eyes were eager to look into the cool shaft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I walked round it; I looked right down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw my image mirrored on the face of the pool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An earthen pitcher was sinking into the black depths;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no rope to pull it to the well-head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was strangely troubled lest the pitcher should be lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And started wildly running to look for help.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From village to village I scoured that high plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men were gone: the dogs leapt at my throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I came back and walked weeping round the well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faster and faster the blinding tears flowed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till my own sobbing suddenly woke me up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My room was silent; no one in the house stirred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flame of my candle flickered with a green smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears I had shed glittered in the candle-light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bell sounded; I knew it was the midnight-chime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sat up in bed and tried to arrange my thoughts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The plain in my dream was the graveyard at Ch&#8216;ang-an,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those hundred acres of untilled land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soil heavy and the mounds heaped high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dead below them laid in deep troughs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep are the troughs, yet sometimes dead men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find their way to the world above the grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to-night my love who died long ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came into my dream as the pitcher sunk in the well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was why the tears suddenly streamed from my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Streamed from my eyes and fell on the collar of my dress.<br /></span>

<p>Miss Li, ennobled with the title &#8220;Lady of Ch&#8216;ien-kuo,&#8221;
was once a prostitute in Ch&#8216;ang-an. The devotion of her
conduct was so remarkable that I have thought it worth
while to record her story. In the T&#8216;ien-pao era<a name="FNanchor_1_48" id="FNanchor_1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_48" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> there was
a certain nobleman, Governor of Ch&#8216;ang-chou and Lord of
Jung-yang, whose name and surname I will omit. He was
a man of great wealth and highly esteemed by all. He had
passed his fiftieth year and had a son who was close on
twenty, a boy who in literary talent outstripped all his companions.
His father was proud of him and had great hopes
of his future. &#8220;This,&#8221; he would say, &#8220;is the &#8216;thousand-league
colt&#8217; of our family.&#8221; When the time came for the
lad to compete at the Provincial Examinations, his father
gave him fine clothes and a handsome coach with richly
caparisoned horses for the journey; and to provide for his
expense at the Capital, he gave him a large sum of money,
saying, &#8220;I am sure that your talent is such that you will
succeed at the first attempt; but I am giving you two
years&#8217; supply, that you may pursue your career free from
all anxiety.&#8221; The young man was also quite confident and
saw himself getting the first place as clearly as he saw the
palm of his own hand.</p>

<p>Starting from P&#8216;i-ling<a name="FNanchor_2_49" id="FNanchor_2_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_49" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he reached Ch&#8216;ang-an in a few
weeks and took a house in the Pu-ch&#275;ng quarter. One day
he was coming back from a visit to the Eastern Market. He
entered the City by the eastern gate of P&#8216;ing-k&#8216;ang and was
going to visit a friend who lived in the south-western part
of the town. When he reached the Ming-k&#8216;o Bend, he saw
<a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>a house of which the gate and courtyard were rather narrow;
but the house itself was stately and stood well back
from the road. One of the double doors was open, and at
it stood a lady, attended by her maid-servant. She was of
exquisite, bewitching beauty, such as the world has seldom
produced.</p>

<p>When he saw her, the young man unconsciously reined in
his horse and hesitated. Unable to leave the spot, he purposely
let his whip fall to the ground and waited for his
servant to pick it up, all the time staring at the lady in the
doorway. She too was staring and met his gaze with a look
that seemed to be an answer to his admiration. But in the
end he went away without daring to speak to her.</p>

<p>But he could not put the thought of her out of his mind
and secretly begged those of his friends who were most
expert in the pleasures of Ch&#8216;ang-an to tell him what they
knew of the girl. He learnt from them that the house belonged
to a low and unprincipled woman named Li. When
he asked what chance he had of winning the daughter, they
answered: &#8220;The woman Li is possessed of considerable
property, for her previous dealings have been with wealthy
and aristocratic families, from whom she has received enormous
sums. Unless you are willing to spend many thousand
pounds, the daughter will have nothing to do with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man answered: &#8220;All I care about is to win
her. I do not mind if she costs a million pounds.&#8221; The
next day he set out in his best clothes, with many servants
riding behind him, and knocked at the door of Mrs. Li&#8217;s
house. Immediately a page-boy drew the bolt. The young
man asked, &#8220;Can you tell me whose house this is?&#8221; The
boy did not answer, but ran back into the house and called
<a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>out at the top of his voice, &#8220;Here is the gentleman who
dropped his whip the other day!&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Li was evidently very much pleased. He heard her
saying, &#8220;Be sure not to let him go away. I am just going
to do my hair and change my clothes; I will be back in a
minute.&#8221; The young man, in high spirits, followed the
page-boy into the house. A white-haired old lady was going
upstairs, whom he took to be the girl&#8217;s mother. Bowing
low, the young man addressed her as follows: &#8220;I am told
that you have a vacant plot of land, which you would be
willing to let as building-ground. Is that true?&#8221; The
old lady answered, &#8220;I am afraid the site is too mean and
confined; it would be quite unsuitable for a gentleman&#8217;s
house. I should not like to offer it to you.&#8221; She then took
him into the guest-room, which was a very handsome one,
and asked him to be seated, saying, &#8220;I have a daughter who
has little either of beauty or accomplishment, but she is
fond of seeing strangers. I should like you to meet her.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, she called for her daughter, who presently entered.
Her eyes sparkled with such fire, her arms were so
dazzling white and there was in her movements such an exquisite
grace that the young man could only leap to his
feet in confusion and did not dare raise his eyes. When
their salutations were over, he began to make a few remarks
about the weather; and realized as he did so that her
beauty was of a kind he had never encountered before.</p>

<p>They sat down again. Tea was made and wine poured
out. The vessels used were spotlessly clean. He lingered
till the day was almost over; the curfew-drum sounded its
four beats. The old lady asked if he lived far away. He
answered untruthfully, &#8220;Several leagues beyond the Yen-p&#8216;ing
Gate,&#8221; hoping that they would ask him to stay. The
<a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>old lady said, &#8220;The drum has sounded. You will have to
go back at once, unless you mean to break the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man answered, &#8220;I was being so agreeably entertained
that I did not notice how rapidly the day had fled.
My house is a long way off and in the city I have no friends
or relations. What am I to do?&#8221; Miss Li then interposed,
saying, &#8220;If you can forgive the meanness of our poor home,
what harm would there be in your spending the night with
us?&#8221; He looked doubtfully at the girl&#8217;s mother, but met
with no discouragement.</p>

<p>Calling his servants, he gave them money and told them
to buy provisions for the night. But the girl laughingly
stopped him, saying, &#8220;That is not the way guests are entertained.
Our humble house will provide for your wants
to-night, if you are willing to partake of our simple fare
and defer your bounty to another occasion.&#8221; He tried to
refuse, but in the end she would not allow him to, and they
all moved to the western hall. The curtains, screens, blinds
and couches were of dazzling splendour; while the toilet-boxes,
rugs, and pillows were of the utmost elegance.
Candles were lighted and an excellent supper was served.</p>

<p>After supper the old lady retired, leaving the lovers engaged
in the liveliest conversation, laughing and chattering
completely at their ease.</p>

<p>After a while the young man said: &#8220;I passed your house
the other day and you happened to be standing at the door.
And after that, I could think of nothing but you; whether I
lay down to rest or sat down to eat, I could not stop thinking
of you.&#8221; She laughed and answered: &#8220;It was just the
same with me.&#8220; He said: &#8220;You must know that I did not
come to-day simply to look for building-land. I came
<a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>hoping that you would fulfil my lifelong desire; but I was
not sure how you would welcome me. What&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had not finished speaking when the old woman came
back and asked what they were saying. When they told
her, she laughed and said, &#8220;Has not Mencius written that
&#8216;the relationship between men and women is the ground-work
of society&#8217;? When lovers are agreed, not even the
mandate of a parent will deter them. But my daughter is
of humble birth. Are you sure that she is fit to &#8216;present
pillow and mat&#8217; to a great man?&#8221;</p>

<p>He came down from the da&iuml;s and, bowing low, begged
that she would accept him as her slave. Henceforward the
old lady regarded him as her son-in-law; they drank heavily
together and finally parted. Next morning he had all his
boxes and bags brought round to Mrs. Li&#8217;s house and settled
there permanently. Henceforward he shut himself up with
his mistress and none of his friends ever heard of him.
He consorted only with actors and dancers and low people
of that kind, passing the time in wild sports and wanton
feasting. When his money was all spent, he sold his horses
and men-servants. In about a year his money, property,
servants and horses were all gone.</p>

<p>For some time the old lady&#8217;s manner towards him had
been growing gradually colder, but his mistress remained as
devoted as ever. One day she said to him, &#8220;We have been
together a year, but I am still not with child. They say
that the spirit of the Bamboo Grove answers a woman&#8217;s
prayers as surely as an echo. Let us go to his temple and
offer a libation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man, not suspecting any plot, was delighted to
take her to the temple, and having pawned his coat to buy
sweet wine for the libation, he went with her and performed
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>the ceremony of prayer. They stayed one night at the
temple and came back next day. Whipping up their donkey,
they soon arrived at the north gate of the P&#8216;ing-k&#8216;ang quarter.
At this point his mistress turned to him and said, &#8220;My
aunt&#8217;s house is in a turning just near here. How would it
be if we were to go there and rest for a little?&#8221;</p>

<p>He drove on as she directed him, and they had not gone
more than a hundred paces, when he saw the entrance to a
spacious carriage-drive. A servant who belonged to the
place came out and stopped the cart, saying, &#8220;This is the
entrance.&#8221; The young man got down and was met by some
one who came out and asked who they were. When told
that it was Miss Li, he went back and announced her.
Presently a married lady came out who seemed to be about
forty. She greeted him, saying, &#8220;Has my niece arrived?&#8221;
Miss Li then got out of the cart and her aunt said to her:
&#8220;Why have you not been to see me for so long?&#8221; At
which they looked at one another and laughed. Then Miss
Li introduced him to her aunt and when that was over they
all went into a side garden near the Western Halberd Gate.
In the middle of the garden was a pagoda, and round it grew
bamboos and trees of every variety, while ponds and summer-houses
added to its air of seclusion. He asked Miss
Li if this were her aunt&#8217;s estate; she laughed, but did not
answer and spoke of something else.</p>

<p>Tea of excellent quality was served; but when they had
been drinking it for a little while, a messenger came galloping
up on a huge Fergana horse, saying that Miss Li&#8217;s
mother had suddenly been taken very ill and had already
lost consciousness, so that they had better come back as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Miss Li said to her aunt: &#8220;I am very much upset. I
<a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>think I had better take the horse and ride on ahead. Then I
will send it back, and you and my husband can come along
later.&#8221; The young man was anxious to go with her, but
the aunt and her servants engaged him in conversation,
flourishing their hands in front of him and preventing him
from leaving the garden. The aunt said to him: &#8220;No doubt
my sister is dead by this time. You and I ought to discuss
together what can be done to help with the expenses of the
burial. What is the use of running off like that? Stay
here and help me to make a plan for the funeral and mourning
ceremonies.&#8221;</p>

<p>It grew late; but the messenger had not returned. The
aunt said: &#8220;I am surprised he has not come back with the
horse. You had better go there on foot as quickly as possible
and see what has happened. I will come on later.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man set out on foot for Mrs. Li&#8217;s house.
When he got there he found the gate firmly bolted, locked
and sealed. Astounded, he questioned the neighbors, who
told him that the house had only been let to Mrs. Li and
that, the lease having expired, the landlord had now resumed
possession. The old lady, they said, had gone to
live elsewhere. They did not know her new address.</p>

<p>At first he thought of hurrying back to Hs&uuml;an-yang and
questioning the aunt; but he found it was too late for him
to get there. So he pawned some of his clothes, and, with
the proceeds, bought himself supper and hired a bed. But
he was too angry and distressed to sleep, and did not once
close his eyes from dusk till dawn. Early in the morning
he dragged himself away and went to the &#8220;aunt&#8217;s house.&#8221;
He knocked on the door repeatedly, but it was breakfast-time
and no one answered. At last, when he had shouted
several times at the top of his voice, a footman walked
<a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>majestically to the door. The young man nervously mentioned
the aunt&#8217;s name and asked whether she was at home.
The footman replied: &#8220;No one of that name here.&#8221; &#8220;But
she lived here yesterday evening,&#8221; the young man protested;
&#8220;why are you trying to deceive me? If she does
not live here, who <i>does</i> the house belong to?&#8221; The footman
answered: &#8220;This is the residence of His Excellency
Mr. Ts&#8216;ui. I believe that yesterday some persons hired a
corner of the grounds. I understand that they wished to
entertain a cousin who was coming from a distance. But
they were gone before nightfall.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man, perplexed and puzzled to the point of
madness, was absolutely at a loss what to do next. The
best he could think of was to go to the quarters in Pu-ch&#275;ng,
where he had installed himself when he first arrived at Ch&#8216;ang-an.
The landlord was sympathetic and offered to
feed him. But the young man was too much upset to eat,
and having fasted for three days fell seriously ill. He
rapidly grew worse, and the landlord, fearing he would not
recover, had him moved straight to the undertaker&#8217;s shop.
In a short time the whole of the undertaker&#8217;s staff
was collected round him, offering sympathy and bringing
him food. Gradually he got better and was able to walk
with a stick.</p>

<p>The undertaker now hired him by the day to hold up the
curtains of fine cloth, by which he earned just enough to
support himself. In a few months he grew quite strong
again, but whenever he heard the mourners&#8217; doleful songs,
in which they regretted that they could not change places
with the corpse, burst into violent fits of sobbing and shed
streams of tears over which they lost all control, then he
used to go home and imitate their performance.</p>

<p><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>Being a man of intelligence, he very soon mastered the
art and finally became the most expert mourner in Ch&#8216;ang-an.
It happened that there were two undertakers at this
time between whom there was a great rivalry. The undertaker
of the east turned out magnificent hearses and biers,
and in this respect his superiority could not be contested.
But the mourners he provided were somewhat inferior.
Hearing of our young man&#8217;s skill, he offered him a large
sum for his services. The eastern undertaker&#8217;s supporters,
who were familiar with the repertoire of his company,
secretly taught the young man several fresh tunes and
showed him how to fit the words to them. The lessons
went on for several weeks, without any one being allowed to
know of it. At the end of that time the two undertakers
agreed to hold a competitive exhibition of their wares in
T&#8216;ien-m&#275;n Street. The loser was to forfeit 50,000 cash to
cover the cost of the refreshments provided. Before the
exhibition an agreement was drawn up and duly signed by
witnesses.</p>

<p>A crowd of several thousand people collected to watch the
competition. The mayor of the quarter got wind of the
proceedings and told the chief of police. The chief of
police told the governor of the city. Very soon all the
gentlemen of Ch&#8216;ang-an were hurrying to the spot and
every house in the town was empty. The exhibition lasted
from dawn till midday. Coaches, hearses and all kinds
of funeral trappings were successively displayed, but the
undertaker of the west could establish no superiority.
Filled with shame, he set up a platform in the south corner
of the square. Presently a man with a long beard came
forward, carrying a hand-bell and attended by several
assistants. He wagged his beard, raised his eyebrows,
<a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>folded his arms across his chest and bowed. Then, mounting
the platform, he sang the &#8220;Dirge of the White Horse.&#8221;
When it was over, confident of an easy victory, he glared
round him, as if to imply that his opponents had all vanished.
He was applauded on every side and was himself
convinced that his talents were a unique product of the age
and could not possibly be called into question.</p>

<p>After a while the undertaker of the east put together some
benches in the north corner of the square, and a young man
in a black hat came forward, attended by five assistants and
carrying a bunch of hearse-plumes in his hand. It was the
young man of our story.</p>

<p>He adjusted his clothes, looked timidly up and down,
and then cleared his throat and began his tune with an air
of great diffidence.</p>

<p>He sang the dirge &#8220;Dew on the Garlic.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_3_50" id="FNanchor_3_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_50" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> His voice rose
so shrill and clear that &#8220;its echoes shook the forest trees.&#8221;
Before he had finished the first verse, all who heard were
sobbing and hiding their tears.</p>

<p>When the performance was over, every one made fun of
the western undertaker, and he was so much put out that he
immediately removed his exhibits and retired from the
contest. The audience was amazed by the collapse of the
western undertaker and could not imagine where his rival
had procured so remarkable a singer.</p>

<p>It happened that the Emperor had recently issued an
order commanding the governors of outside provinces to
confer with him at the capital at least once a year.</p>

<p>At this time the young man&#8217;s father, who was governor
of Ch&#8216;ang-chou, had recently arrived at the capital to make
his report. Hearing of the competition, he and some of
<a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>his colleagues discarded their official robes and insignia, and
slipped away to join the crowd. With them was an old
servant, who was the husband of the young man&#8217;s foster-nurse.
Recognizing his foster-son&#8217;s way of moving and
speaking, he was on the point of accosting him, but not
daring to do so, he stood weeping silently. The father
asked him why he was crying, and the servant replied, &#8220;Sir,
the young man who is singing reminds me of your lost
son.&#8221; The father answered: &#8220;My son became the prey of
robbers, because I gave him too much money. This cannot
be he.&#8221; So saying, he also began to weep and, leaving the
crowd, returned to his lodging.</p>

<p>But the old servant went about among the members of the
troupe, asking who it was that had just sung with such
skill. They all told him it was the son of such a one; and
when he asked the young man&#8217;s own name, that too was unfamiliar,
for he was living under an <i>alias</i>. The old servant
was so much puzzled that he determined to put the matter
to the test for himself. But when the young man saw his
old friend walking towards him, he winced, turned away his
face, and tried to hide in the crowd. The old man followed
him and catching his sleeve, said: &#8220;Surely it is you!&#8221;
Then they embraced and wept. Presently they went back
together to his father&#8217;s lodging. But his father abused him,
saying: &#8220;Your conduct has disgraced the family. How
dare you show your face again?&#8221; So saying, he took him
out of the house and led him to the ground between the
Ch&#8216;&uuml;-chiang Pond and the Apricot Gardens. Here he
stripped him naked and thrashed him with his horse-whip,
till the young man succumbed to the pain and collapsed.
The father then left him and went away.</p>

<p>But the young man&#8217;s singing-master had told some of his
<a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>friends to watch what happened to him. When they saw
him stretched inanimate on the ground, they came back and
told the other members of the troupe.</p>

<p>The news occasioned universal lamentation, and two men
were despatched with a reed mat to cover up the body.
When they got there they found his heart still warm, and
when they had held him in an upright posture for some
time, his breathing recommenced. So they carried him
home between them and administered liquid food through a
reed-pipe. Next morning, he recovered consciousness; but
after several months he was still unable to move his hands
and feet. Moreover, the sores left by his thrashing festered
in so disgusting a manner that his friends found him too
troublesome, and one night deposited him in the middle of
the road. However, the passers-by, harrowed by his condition,
never failed to throw him scraps of food.</p>

<p>So copious was his diet that in three months he recovered
sufficiently to hobble with a stick. Clad in a linen coat,&mdash;which
was knotted together in a hundred places, so that it
looked as tattered as a quail&#8217;s tail,&mdash;and carrying a broken
saucer in his hand, he now went about the idle quarters of
the town, earning his living as a professional beggar.</p>

<p>Autumn had now turned to winter. He spent his nights
in public lavatories and his days haunting the markets and
booths.</p>

<p>One day when it was snowing hard, hunger and cold had
driven him into the streets. His beggar&#8217;s cry was full of
woe and all who heard it were heart-rent. But the snow was
so heavy that hardly a house had its outer door open, and
the streets were empty.</p>

<p>When he reached the eastern gate of An-i, about the
<a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>seventh or eighth turning north of the Hs&uuml;n-li Wall, there
was a house with the double-doors half open.</p>

<p>It was the house where Miss Li was then living, but
the young man did not know.</p>

<p>He stood before the door, wailing loud and long.</p>

<p>Hunger and cold had given such a piteous accent to his
cry that none could have listened unmoved.</p>

<p>Miss Li heard it from her room and at once said to her
servant, &#8220;That is so-and-so. I know his voice.&#8221; She flew
to the door and was horrified to see her old lover standing
before her so emaciated by hunger and disfigured by sores
that he seemed scarcely human. &#8220;Can it be you?&#8221; she
said. But the young man was so overcome by bewilderment
and excitement that he could not speak, but only
moved his lips noiselessly.</p>

<p>She threw her arms round his neck, then wrapped him in
her own embroidered jacket and led him to the parlour.
Here, with quavering voice, she reproached herself, saying,
&#8220;It is my doing that you have been brought to this pass.&#8221;
And with these words she swooned.</p>

<p>Her mother came running up in great excitement, asking
who had arrived. Miss Li, recovering herself, said who it
was. The old woman cried out in rage: &#8220;Send him away!
What did you bring him in here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Miss Li looked up at her defiantly and said: &#8220;Not so!
This is the son of a noble house. Once he rode in grand
coaches and wore golden trappings on his coat. But when
he came to our house, he soon lost all he had; and then we
plotted together and left him destitute. Our conduct has
indeed been inhuman! We have ruined his career and
robbed him even of his place in the category of human relationships.
For the love of father and son is implanted
<a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>by Heaven; yet we have hardened his father&#8217;s heart, so that
he beat him with a stick and left him on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every one in the land knows that it is I who have reduced
him to his present plight. The Court is full of his
kinsmen. Some day one of them will come into power.
Then an inquiry will be set afoot, and disaster will overtake
us. And since we have flouted Heaven and defied the laws
of humanity, neither spirits nor divinities will be on our
side. Let us not wantonly incur a further retribution!</p>

<p>&#8220;I have lived as your daughter for twenty years. Reckoning
what I have cost you in that time, I find it must be
close on a thousand pieces of gold. You are now aged
sixty, so that by the price of twenty more years&#8217; food and
clothing, I can buy my freedom. I intend to live separately
with this young man. We will not go far away; I shall
see to it that we are near enough to pay our respects to you
both morning and evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;mother&#8221; saw that she was not to be gainsaid and
fell in with the arrangement. When she had paid her ransom,
Miss Li had a hundred pieces of gold left over; and
with them she hired a vacant room, five doors away. Here
she gave the young man a bath, changed his clothes, fed him
with hot soup to relax his stomach, and later on fattened
him up with cheese and milk.</p>

<p>In a few weeks she began to place before him all the
choicest delicacies of land and sea; and she clothed him
with cap, shoes and stockings of the finest quality. In a
short time he began gradually to put on flesh, and by the
end of the year, he had entirely recovered his former health.</p>

<p>One day Miss Li said to him: &#8220;Now your limbs are stout
again and your will strong! Sometimes, when deeply pondering
in silent sorrow, I wonder to myself how much you
<a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>remember of your old literary studies?&#8221; He thought and
answered: &#8220;Of ten parts I remember two or three.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Li then ordered the carriage to be got ready and the
young man followed her on horseback. When they reached
the classical bookshop at the side-gate south of the Flag tower,
she made him choose all the books he wanted, till she
had laid out a hundred pieces of gold. Then she packed
them in the cart and drove home. She now made him dismiss
all other thoughts from his mind and apply himself
only to study. All the evening he toiled at his books, with
Miss Li at his side, and they did not retire till midnight.
If ever she found that he was too tired to work, she made
him lay down his classics and write a poem or ode.</p>

<p>In two years he had thoroughly mastered his subjects and
was admired by all the scholars of the realm. He said to
Miss Li, &#8220;<i>Now</i>, surely, I am ready for the examiners!&#8221; but
she would not let him compete and made him revise all he
had learnt, to prepare for the &#8220;hundredth battle.&#8221; At the
end of the third year she said, &#8220;Now you may go.&#8221; He
went in for the examination and passed at the first attempt.
His reputation spread rapidly through the examination
rooms and even older men, when they saw his compositions,
were filled with admiration and respect, and sought
his friendship.</p>

<p>But Miss Li would not let him make friends with them,
saying, &#8220;Wait a little longer! Nowadays when a bachelor
of arts has passed his examination, he thinks himself fit to
hold the most advantageous posts at Court and to win a
universal reputation. But your unfortunate conduct and
disreputable past put you at a disadvantage beside your
fellow-scholars. You must &#8216;grind, temper and sharpen&#8217;
your attainments, that you may secure a second victory.
<a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>Then you will be able to match yourself against famous
scholars and contend with the illustrious.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man accordingly increased his efforts and enhanced
his value. That year it happened that the Emperor
had decreed a special examination for the selection of
candidates of unusual merit from all parts of the Empire.
The young man competed, and came out top in the &#8220;censorial
essay.&#8221; He was offered the post of Army Inspector
at Ch&#8216;&#275;ng-tu Fu. The officers who were to escort him were
all previous friends.</p>

<p>When he was about to take up his post, Miss Li said to
him, &#8220;Now that you are restored to your proper station in
life, I will not be a burden to you. Let me go back and
look after the old lady till she dies. You must ally yourself
with some lady of noble lineage, who will be worthy
to carry the sacrificial dishes in your Ancestral Hall. Do
not injure your prospects by an unequal union. Good-bye,
for now I must leave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man burst into tears and threatened to kill
himself if she left him, but she obstinately refused to go
with him. He begged her passionately not to desert him,
and she at last consented to go with him across the river
as far as Chien-m&#275;n.<a name="FNanchor_4_51" id="FNanchor_4_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_51" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> &#8220;There,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you must part
with me.&#8221; The young man consented and in a few weeks
they reached Chien-m&#275;n. Before he had started out again,
a proclamation arrived announcing that the young man&#8217;s
father, who had been Governor of Ch&#8216;ang-chou, had been
appointed Governor of Ch&#8216;&#275;ng-tu and Intendant of the
Chien-nan Circuit. Next morning the father arrived, and
the young man sent in his card and waited upon him at the
<a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>posting-station. His father did not recognize him, but the
card bore the names of the young man&#8217;s father and grandfather,
with their ranks and titles. When he read these, he
was astounded, and bidding his son mount the steps he
caressed him and wept. After a while he said: &#8220;Now we
two are father and son once more,&#8221; and bade him tell his
story. When he heard of the young man&#8217;s adventures, he
was amazed. Presently he asked: &#8220;And where is Miss
Li?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;She came with me as far as here, but
now she is going back again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot allow it,&#8221; the father said. Next day he ordered
a carriage for his son and sent him on to report
himself at Ch&#8216;&#275;ng-tu; but he detained Miss Li at Chien-m&#275;n,
found her a suitable lodging and ordered a match-maker to
perform the initial ceremonies for uniting the two families
and to accomplish the six rites of welcome. The young
man came back from Ch&#8216;&#275;ng-tu and they were duly married.
In the years that followed their marriage, Miss Li
showed herself a devoted wife and competent housekeeper,
and was beloved by all her relations.</p>

<p>Some years later both the young man&#8217;s parents died, and
in his mourning observances he showed unusual piety. As
a mark of divine favour, magic toadstools grew on the roof
of his mourning-hut,<a name="FNanchor_5_52" id="FNanchor_5_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_52" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> each stem bearing three plants. The
report of his virtue reached even the Emperor&#8217;s ears. Moreover
a number of white swallows nested in the beams of his
roof, an omen which so impressed the Emperor that he
raised his rank immediately.</p>

<p>When the three years of mourning were over, he was
<a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>successively promoted to various distinguished posts and in
the course of ten years was Governor of several provinces.
Miss Li was given the fief of Chien-kuo, with the title &#8220;The
Lady of Chien-kuo.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had four sons who all held high rank. Even the least
successful of them became Governor of T&#8216;ai-y&uuml;an, and his
brothers all married into great families, so that his good
fortune both in public and private life was without parallel.</p>

<p>How strange that we should find in the conduct of a
prostitute a degree of constancy rarely equalled even by the
heroines of history! Surely the story is one which cannot
but provoke a sigh!</p>

<p>My great-uncle was Governor of Chin-chou; subsequently
he joined the Ministry of Finance and became Inspector of
Waterways, and finally Inspector of Roads. In all these
three offices he had Miss Li&#8217;s husband as his colleague, so
that her story was well known to him in every particular.
During the Ch&#275;ng-y&uuml;an period<a name="FNanchor_6_53" id="FNanchor_6_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_53" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I was sitting one day with
Li Kung-tso<a name="FNanchor_7_54" id="FNanchor_7_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_54" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> of Lung-hai; we fell to talking of wives who
had distinguished themselves by remarkable conduct. I
told him the story of Miss Li. He listened with rapt attention,
and when it was over, asked me to write it down for
him. So I took up my brush, wetted the hairs and made
this rough outline of the story.</p>

<p>Master Ou-yang was reading his books<a name="FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_55" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at night when he
heard a strange sound coming from the north-west. He
paused and listened intently, saying to himself: &#8220;How
strange, how strange!&#8221; First there was a pattering and
rustling; but suddenly this broke into a great churning and
crashing, like the noise of waves that wake the traveller at
night, when wind and rain suddenly come; and where they
lash the ship, there is a jangling and clanging as of metal
against metal.</p>

<p>Or again, like the sound of soldiers going to battle, who
march swiftly with their gags<a name="FNanchor_2_56" id="FNanchor_2_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_56" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> between their teeth, when
the captain&#8217;s voice cannot be heard, but only the tramp
of horses and men moving.</p>

<p>I called to my boy, bidding him go out and see what
noise this could be. The boy said: &#8220;The moon and stars
are shining; the Milky Way glitters in the sky. Nowhere is
there any noise of men. The noise must be in the trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I-hsi! alas!&#8221; I said, &#8220;this must be the sound of
Autumn. Oh, why has Autumn come? For as to Autumn&#8217;s
form, her colours are mournful and pale. Mists
scatter and clouds withdraw. Her aspect is clean and
bright. The sky is high and the sunlight clear as crystal.
Her breath is shivering and raw, pricking men&#8217;s skin and
bones; her thoughts are desolate, bringing emptiness and
silence to the rivers and hills. And hence it is that her
whisperings are sorrowful and cold, but her shouts are wild
and angry. Pleasant grasses grew soft and green, vying in
<a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>rankness. Fair trees knit their shade and gave delight.
Autumn swept the grasses and their colour changed; she met
the trees, and their boughs were stripped. And because
Autumn&#8217;s being is compounded of sternness, therefore it
was that they withered and perished, fell and decayed. For
Autumn is an executioner,<a name="FNanchor_3_57" id="FNanchor_3_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_57" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and her hour is darkness. She
is a warrior, and her element is metal. Therefore she is
called &#8216;the doom-spirit of heaven and earth&#8217;;<a name="FNanchor_4_58" id="FNanchor_4_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_58" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> for her
thoughts are bent on stern destruction.</p>

<p>&#8220;In Spring, growth; in Autumn, fruit: that is Heaven&#8217;s
plan. Therefore in music the note <i>shang</i> is the symbol of
the West and <i>I-ts&#275;</i> is the pitch-pipe of the seventh month.
For <i>shang</i> means &#8216;<i>to strike</i>&#8217;; when things grow old they are
stricken by grief. And <i>I</i> means &#8216;<i>to slay</i>&#8217;; things that have
passed their prime must needs be slain. Plants and trees
have no feelings; when their time comes they are blown
down. But man moves and lives and is of creatures most
divine. A hundred griefs assail his heart, ten thousand
tasks wear out his limbs, and each inward stirring shakes the
atoms of his soul. And all the more, when he thinks of
things that his strength cannot achieve or grieves at things
his mind cannot understand, is it strange that cheeks that
were steeped in red should grow withered as an old stick,

<p>An essay on Po Ch&uuml;-i, whose poems occupy most of this
book, will be found in &#8220;170 Chinese Poems.&#8221; The fullest
account of Li Po&#8217;s life (with translations) is given
in a paper read by me to the China Society, and published
in the <i>Asiatic Review</i>, July, 1919. Notices of Ch&#8216;&uuml; Y&uuml;an,
Wang Wei, Y&uuml;an Ch&#275;n, Wang Chien and Ou-yang Hsiu will
be found in Giles&#8217;s &#8220;Biographical Dictionary.&#8221; To Wang
Chieh Po Ch&uuml;-i addressed several poems.</p>

<p>Of the 68 pieces in this book, 55 are now translated for
the first time. Of the eight poems by Li Po, all but Number
6 have been translated before, some of them by several
hands.</p>

<p>Among the poems by Po Ch&uuml;-i, three (Nos. 11, 12, and
44) have been translated by Woitsch<a name="FNanchor_1_59" id="FNanchor_1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_59" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and one, (No. 43),
very incorrectly, by Pfizmaier. Another (No. 21) was
translated into rhymed verse by Prof. Giles in &#8220;Adversaria
Sinica&#8221; (1914), p. 323. Ou-yang Hsiu&#8217;s &#8220;Autumn&#8221; was
translated by Giles (with great freedom in many places)
in his &#8220;Chinese Literature,&#8221; p. 215.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
